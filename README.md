# Hi, I’m Krzysztof 👋

I’m a molecular diagnostics scientist with a strong interest in **computational biology, immunology, and protein-level analysis**.

My work focuses on using **in-silico methods** to:
- explore molecular mechanisms of disease,
- prioritise biologically meaningful hypotheses,
- and build reproducible analysis pipelines that can inform experimental work.

## 🔬 Current focus

- Molecular mimicry and autoimmunity
- Protein sequence analysis
- Immunoinformatics (MHC-II antigen presentation)
- Reproducible bioinformatics workflows
- Translational research bridging wet lab and computation

## 🧬 Featured project

### **Investigation of M-protein auto-immunogenicity**
🔗 https://github.com/bkhimek/M_protein_autoimmunogenicity

An in-silico study of **Streptococcus pyogenes M-protein** variation and its potential role in
**post-infectious autoimmunity**, including rheumatic fever.

**Key elements:**
- MAFFT-based sequence alignment and region curation
- Sliding-window peptide generation (15-mers)
- Quantitative molecular mimicry scoring against human cardiac proteins
- Strain-specific (emm-type) comparison
- **MHC class II prioritisation using DeepMHCII**
- Script-only, reproducible pipeline

This project demonstrates how **sequence similarity, immunological context, and population genetics**
can be combined to generate testable hypotheses.
